Ideas
    Story
        The Rogue (Rogue Engineer on a task to destroy corporations)
            ☐ Gets better prices on black market upgrades
            ☐ Gets hit hard by innovations by corporations
            ☐ Game begins really easy but corporations adapt really fast to the last plays
        The CEO (CEO of a known corporation)
            ☐ Has links to other corporations for fair discounts on upgrades
            ☐ Has to maintain relationships by representation in selecting upgrades
            ☐ The corporations should provide lesser benefits to balance
            ☐ Initial gameplay loop is about getting the best alignment with other corporations
            ☐ Late game is about maintaining the relationships with occasional backstabbing
        The Salary-man (An employee of a corporation)
            ☐ Can use black market upgrades but at the risk of being caught
            ☐ Game begins with few easy rounds but shit hits the fan with targeted attacks

    Text Prompts
        ☐ A backdoor was installed. (Show infected area)
    Special powers
        ☐ Sniper
            ☐ ⟴
        ☐ DDoS
            ☐ Attacks spreads from root node and consumes almost all power from your own mainframe's nodes
            ☐ Show like an orbital laser directly hitting the node

        ☐ Infestation
            ☐ [Alerts] the opponent about the occurrence
            ☐ Requires [Health Scan] to be detected
            ☐ Stays dormant for <X> turns
            ☐ Starts exponentially expanding in all directions if not [Treated]

        ☐ Sonar
            ☐ Scans the frontline of the opponent
            ☐ May go deeper depending on node transparency
            ☐ BFS
            ☐ Gives out shield and power rating for the opponent's node

        ☐ Bleeder
            ☐ [Single] target
            ☐ Applies [Data Bleed] to target node for <X> turns

        ☐ Siphon
            ☐

        ☐ Ventriloquist
            ☐

        ☐ Phisher
            ☐ Mask one of your own nodes as something else

        ☐ Botnet
            ☐ Cluster bomb
            ☐ Seeps shield from cluster of selected nodes on use

        ☐ Backdoor
            ☐

        ☐ Nuke
            ☐ Sets shields to 0 in AoE
            ☐ Applies [Data Bleed]
            ☐ AoE in all directions for radius <X>
            ☐

    Mechanic options
        ☐ Self-Amputation
            ☐ Cut of a node cluster from the mainframe
            ☐ Stops infestation

        ☐ Data Bleed
            ☐ Reduced shield recharge rate

        ☐ Upkeep nodes
            ☐ Remove all health regeneration from the node and distribute it to parent, siblings and children

        ☐ Health scan
            ☐ BFS check for any backdoor or poisoned nodes

        ☐ Deep scan
            ☐ Ability to decide the scan path (greedy DFS)
            ☐ Show live DFS with glow on the lines connecting the nodes
